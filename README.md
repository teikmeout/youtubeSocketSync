# Node + Express + Socket.io + Youtube iFrame API

This is a web application that uses a backend Node+Express server.  
The backend server connects to it's clients via socket.io websockets connections.  
The user triggers listeners of the youtube iFrame API script that we use to trigger socket emits (broadcasts) that will be resent by the server to all.
